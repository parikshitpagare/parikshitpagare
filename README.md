> **I truly believe technology can help create a better world and improve quality of life.**  

I am an Embedded Software Developer with a background in Electronics Engineering. Developing systems with a combination of hardware and software is something I have always been passionate about. As a self taught programmer, I found microcontroller programming more exciting due its vast applications in real world. 

All the projects I share are developed from scratch applying my knowledge and skills.
